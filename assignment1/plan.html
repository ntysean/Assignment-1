  <h1> Project Plan</h1>
  <h1> Assignment 1 - Petite treats website</h1>
  <p>Sean Ng JC443053 </p>
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
  <p>To improve the business of Petite Treats by attracting more young families and people. The website should generate more sales by increasing the influence of Petite Treats to a much wider online audience. It will also
		provide details on ongoing specials as well as a menu with pictures, hoping to generate more attention that way.<br>
  </p>
  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>As other advertising for the shop will be consistent for the next 2 month period, any increase in sales will be attributed to the website. At the end of the 2 month period, sales and number of unique customers will be
					counted and compared to previous months.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The site is primarily targeted at young locals between ages 17-35 that might be interested in grabbing some pastries/buns throughout the day. However, this website also aims to share promotions and sales events with
				all current customers</em>. </p>
